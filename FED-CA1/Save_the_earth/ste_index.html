            <h2>Get to know me</h2>
                <p> Hello there! My name is Caleb and I am a full time student from Singapore Polytechnic and is currently studying in the 
                    school of computing (SOC).
                    
                </p>
            <h2>My values</h2>
                <p>
                    <u><i><strong>Responsibility:</strong></i></u> I take ownership of my own actions and understand that I
                    would be held accountable for my actions toward a more sustainable future.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <u><i><strong>Perserverance:</strong></i></u> I am commited towards my goals and overcoming obstacles despite the
                    difficties.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <u><i><strong>Courage:</strong></i></u> I am willing to make a stand towards my beliefs even when others are not on my side.
                </p>
            <h2>My interests</h2>
            <p>
                I enjoy playing video games such as Valorant and Overwatch in my free time. I am also a avid traveller around the 
                globe during the holidays. Some places I have been to include Korea, Japan, Australia. My love affair with travelling started in my younger days when I got to take in the wonderful 
                sights of the world. Travelling around the world has made me realize that in order to preserve the sights, we need to start 
                working towards a sustainble future.
            </p>
