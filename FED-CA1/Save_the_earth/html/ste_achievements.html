                        The recycling line takes apart solar panels, removing the important parts such as materials like silver and glass to
                        be recycled for other uses. It boasts a recycling capacity of 80 panels a day and that about 95% of the solar panel
                        can be reobtained.

                        SP has also set up 2 labs, SP-Sembcorp Solar PV Research Lab and SP-CHINT Smart Electrical Power Training Laboratory,
                        that would greatly increase the amount of research and development done on solar energy.

               <P>
                   SP has established a new <abbr id="Eseec" title="Enviromental Sustainbility and Energy Efficiency Centre"> ESEEC</abbr>, to work with SMEs. The aim of this
                   centre is to help with carbon management through the sharing of knowledge and resources. The centre acts as a all in one hub
                   that helps companies to build a strong digital capabilities thorugh a range of approaches for the mindsets, skillsets and 
                   behaviors.

               <p>
                   There are initiatives that help to provide real world learning such as indsutry attachements, consultancy projects,
                   and the provision of intensive leadership and senior management programme for businesses that are growing or have the 
                   potential to grow. All of which would help with the improvement and change SMEs for the better.

        <!-- Description of recyling plastic waste -->
           <article>
               <h2>Recycling plastics into asphalt</h2>
               <P>
                    A local construction company, Samwoh, has partnered with SP to utilise plastic waste in asphalt, which is material used
                    to build more durable roads surfaces. Through the recycling of plastic waste, the plastic pollution in the environment
                    can be reduced.
               </P>
               <p>
                   Through this partnership and collaboration, it has been found that asphalt made with plastic waste could last at least
                   20 percent longer than regular asphalt and it had levels of chemicals used that were within the offical guidelines.
                   This is a huge step in the recycling industry as plastic is not easily recycled due to its undecoposing state.
