                In order to achieve a sustainable future, we must all do our part in cutting down on waste and our global carbon footprint.
                We have to make decisions based on long-term consequences instead of always taking the cheapest and easiest solution to
                our fulfil our needs. There are 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) to end poverty, save the earth and try to improve
                the standards of living for people worldwide, rich or poor.

                <p>
                    Hunger and malnutrition is a barrier to a sustainable future. It causes people to be more prone to diseases and become
                    less productive thus making them not able to have a proper income and livelihood. A world with lesser hunger issues can
                    improve our economies, health, education, equality and our social development.

                <h3>Some examples that we can follow:</h3>
                     <ul>
                        <li>Support local markets and make sustainable food choices</li>
                        <li>Have a good diet that is nutritious and healthy</li>

                <p>
                    For a long time, our main sources of energy has been through the burning of coal, oil and gas. But did you know that it 
                    contributes to a large amount of carbon dioxide? This not only affects the environment through climate change, but would
                    also affect the health and well-being of current and future generations through air pollution. Therefore, the solution 
                    would be to use clean and renewable energy sources such as solar energy, and cutting down on unneccsary usage of energy.

                <p>
                    Economic and social progress that we have made has been followed by environmental problems that could very well be
                    endangering our future development and survival. There are many aspects that needs to be changed, ranging from food
                    and product wastage to polltution of the land, water and air that we rely on for survival.
