            <div id="description">
             <p>
                In order to achieve a sustainable future, we must all do our part in cutting down on waste and our global carbon footprint.
                We have to make decisions based on long-term consequences instead of always taking the cheapest and easiest solution to
                our fulfil our needs. There are 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) to end poverty, save the earth and try to improve
                the standards of living for people worldwide, rich or poor.
             </p>

             <!-- 1st goal -->
            <section id="hunger">
            <h2>Goal 1: Reducing hunger worldwide</h2>
                <p>
                    Hunger and malnutrition is a barrier to a sustainable future. It causes people to be more prone to diseases and become
                    less productive thus making them not able to have a proper income and livelihood. A world with lesser hunger issues can
                    improve our economies, health, education, equality and our social development.
                </p>
                <h3>Some examples that we can follow:</h3>
                     <ul>
                        <li>Support local markets and make sustainable food choices</li>
                        <li>Have a good diet that is nutritious and healthy</li>
                        <li>Fight food waste by not wasting food unneccsarily</li>
                    </ul>
            </section>

            <!-- 2nd goal -->
             <section id="energy">
             <h2>Goal 2: Using only clean and affordable energy</h2>
                <p>
                    For a long time, our main sources of energy has been through the burning of coal, oil and gas. But did you know that it 
                    contributes to a large amount of carbon dioxide? This not only affects the environment through climate change, but would
                    also affect the health and well-being of current and future generations through air pollution. Therefore, the solution 
                    would be to use clean and renewable energy sources such as solar energy, and cutting down on unneccsary usage of energy.
                </p>
                <h3>Some examples that we can follow:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Turning off devices when not in use</li>
                        <li>Using energy effcient devices that cuts down on the usage of electricity</li>
                        <li>Investing and switching to more renewable sources of energy such as solar energy or wind energy</li>
                    </ul>
            </section>

            <h2>Goal 3: Producing and consuming responsibly</h2>
                <p>
                    Economic and social progress that we have made has been followed by environmental problems that could very well be
                    endangering our future development and survival. There are many aspects that needs to be changed, ranging from food
                    and product wastage to polltution of the land, water and air that we rely on for survival. 
                </p>
                <h3>Some examples that we can follow:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Reducing your personal waste</li>
                        <li>Be more aware of what you buy and try to choose the sustainable options</li>
                        <li>Reduce, Reuse and Recycle more</li>
